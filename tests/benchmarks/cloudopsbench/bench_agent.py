"""CloudOpsBench-specific investigation agent.

Subclasses :class:`app.agent.investigation.ConnectedInvestigationAgent` to
enforce a minimum-tool-call floor before the agent is allowed to conclude.
Production code is untouched — bench-only termination behavior lives here.

Why we need a floor for the bench
----------------------------------
Production opensre lets the LLM decide when it has enough evidence. That's
the right default for real incidents: latency matters, the LLM is usually
right after a few tool calls, and forcing extra calls wastes tokens.

CloudOpsBench cases are different:
  - The paper's protocol rewards deep multi-source evidence gathering
    (15-20 tool calls typical in winning runs).
  - The June-3 OpenAI bench showed gpt-4o median=7 steps and gpt-5
    median=4 steps — both producing a1=0 despite the agent's structural
    advantage over plain LLM.
  - Tool coverage was 0.20 (gpt-4o) and 0.00 (gpt-5) — agents bailed
    before exercising the tools the paper measures against.

We force the bench agent to gather more evidence before concluding. The
loop's outer cap (``MAX_INVESTIGATION_LOOPS``) still bounds the worst
case, so a stubborn model can't infinite-loop.
